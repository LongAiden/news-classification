The commercial real estate market has been historically slow to modernize, and yet it appears to be accelerating its adoption of artificial intelligence. Companies are moving beyond initial testing and exploration into more targeted applications that aim to redefine value, according to a new survey from JLL. The survey of more than 1,500 senior CRE investor and occupier decision-makers across various industries found that, while still in the early stages, organizations are making AI a priority in their technology budgets. They are also moving from using it just for efficiency to focusing on how it can grow their businesses. JLL found that 88% of investors, owners and landlords said they have started piloting AI, with most pursuing an average of five use cases simultaneously. And more than 90% of occupiers are running corporate real estate AI pilots, according to the report. Compare that with just 5% starting AI pilots two years ago. The adoption is fast, but not entirely easy. Just 5% of respondents said they have achieved all their program goals, while close to half said they have achieved two to three goals. Much of the efforts are still experimental, without much growth. \"If you think about commercial real estate, traditionally, it is not a quick technology adopter, and it\\'s usually skeptical,\" said Yao Morin, chief technology officer at JLL. \"So the high number of adoptions is actually quite surprising to me. What is not surprising on the flip side is that only 5% actually thinks that they have achieved all the goals. This is pretty aligned with a lot of other industries as well.\" Get Property Play directly to your inbox CNBC\\'s Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox. Subscribe here to get access today . The reason they\\'re not hitting their goals is because the goal line has moved. Companies have gone beyond just wanting to do certain tasks faster, or so-called operational efficiencies. Now they are tying AI to their revenue goals. For example, some are using it to help them improve their investment risk models, making investment and portfolio decisions based on the output of AI. That will require big changes to the fundamental way they operate. \"When you really start moving towards the revenue side, the margin expansion side, then it\\'s going to require a lot more than just using a technology,\" Morin explained. \"You can\\'t just say, \\'Well, I\\'m saving you 10% to do this particular thing.\\' Companies need to actually rethink their operating model, to rethink how they organize to actually achieve the savings.\" And so companies are investing heavily in AI, despite economic headwinds. More than half of investors surveyed by JLL have been able to get significant budget growth over the past two years in the space. Their No. 1 spend is on strategic advisory on technology or AI, and most report their budgets have increased solely due to AI. After that, the spending goes to upgrading both cyber- and data-security measures and infrastructure for AI integration. Morin said what she found really surprising is that while most think companies will start using AI for simple tasks, or, low-risk, low-hanging fruit, that was not at all the case. \"Our survey showed the opposite. We are getting to a point of sophistication, beyond this initial skeptical phase, where companies are really focusing on the competitive advantage to pressing business problems, using AI to solve instead of [just] those simple low-risk operations.\" More In CNBC Property Play Why global investment firm Nuveen is betting on this niche real estate subsector Diana Olick Commercial real estate is finally embracing blockchain.

The commercial real estate market has been historically slow to modernize, and yet it appears to be accelerating its adoption of artificial intelligence. Companies are moving beyond initial testing and exploration into more targeted applications that aim to redefine value, according to a new survey from JLL. The survey of more than 1,500 senior CRE investor and occupier decision-makers across various industries found that, while still in the early stages, organizations are making AI a priority in their technology budgets. They are also moving from using it just for efficiency to focusing on how it can grow their businesses.

Companies have gone beyond just wanting to do certain tasks faster, or so-called operational efficiencies. Now they are tying AI to their revenue goals. For example, some are using it to help them improve their investment risk models, making investment and portfolio decisions based on the output of AI. That will require big changes to the fundamental way they operate. \u001b[39m\u001b[33m\"\u001b[39m\u001b[33mWhen you really start moving towards the revenue side, the margin expansion side, then it\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;130;01m\\'\u001b[39;00m\u001b[33ms going to require a lot more than just using a technology,\u001b[39m\u001b[33m\"\u001b[39m\u001b[33m Morin explained. \u001b[39m\u001b[33m\"\u001b[39m\u001b[33mYou can\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;130;01m\\'\u001b[39;00m\u001b[33mt just say, \u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;130;01m\\'\u001b[39;00m\u001b[33mWell, I\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;130;01m\\'\u001b[39;00m\u001b[33mm saving you 10\u001b[39m\u001b[33m%\u001b[39m\u001b[33m to do this particular thing.\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;130;01m\\'\u001b[39;00m\u001b[33m Companies need to actually rethink their operating model, to rethink how they organize to actually achieve the savings.\u001b[39m\u001b[33m\"\u001b[39m\u001b[33m And so companies are investing heavily in AI, despite economic headwinds. More than half of investors surveyed by JLL have been able to get significant budget growth over the past two years in the space. Their No. 1 spend is on strategic advisory on technology or AI, and most report their budgets have increased solely due to AI. After that, the spending goes to upgrading both cyber- and data-security measures and infrastructure for AI integration. Morin said what she found really surprising is that while most think companies will start using AI for simple tasks, or, low-risk, low-hanging fruit, that was not at all the case. \u001b[39m\u001b[33m\"\u001b[39m\u001b[33mOur survey showed the opposite. We are getting to a point of sophistication, beyond this initial skeptical phase, where companies are really focusing on the competitive advantage to pressing business problems, using AI to solve instead of [just] those simple low-risk operations.\u001b[39m\u001b[33m\"\u001b[39m\u001b[33m More In CNBC Property Play Why global investment firm Nuveen is betting on this niche real estate subsector Diana Olick Commercial real estate is finally embracing blockchain.

This is pretty aligned with a lot of other industries as well.\" Get Property Play directly to your inbox CNBC\\'s Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox. Subscribe here to get access today . The reason they\\'re not hitting their goals is because the goal line has moved. Companies have gone beyond just wanting to do certain tasks faster, or so-called operational efficiencies. Now they are tying AI to their revenue goals. For example, some are using it to help them improve their investment risk models, making investment and portfolio decisions based on the output of AI. That will require big changes to the fundamental way they operate. \"When you really start moving towards the revenue side, the margin expansion side, then it\\'s going to require a lot more than just using a technology,\" Morin explained. \"You can\\'t just say, \\'Well, I\\'m saving you 10% to do this particular thing.\\' Companies need to actually rethink their operating model, to rethink how they organize to actually achieve the savings.\" And so companies are investing heavily in AI, despite economic headwinds. More than half of investors surveyed by JLL have been able to get significant budget growth over the past two years in the space. Their No. 1 spend is on strategic advisory on technology or AI, and most report their budgets have increased solely due to AI. After that, the spending goes to upgrading both cyber- and data-security measures and infrastructure for AI integration. Morin said what she found really surprising is that while most think companies will start using AI for simple tasks, or, low-risk, low-hanging fruit, that was not at all the case. \"Our survey showed the opposite. We are getting to a point of sophistication, beyond this initial skeptical phase, where companies are really focusing on the competitive advantage to pressing business problems, using AI to solve instead of [just] those simple low-risk operations.\" More In CNBC Property Play Why global investment firm Nuveen is betting on this niche real estate subsector Diana Olick Commercial real estate is finally embracing blockchain.

U.S. air traffic controllers missed their first full paychecks on Tuesday as the government shutdown drags on. The missed paychecks come as the controllers grapple with a longstanding staffing shortage.

Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty Images Delta Air Lines , United Airlines and American Airlines called on Congress Thursday to reopen the U.S. government and pay air traffic controllers, with Delta urging senators to &quot;immediately pass a clean continuing resolution.&quot; U.S. air traffic controllers missed their first full paychecks on Tuesday as the government shutdown drags on through a fourth week with no end in sight while Republican and Democratic senators remain at an impasse. &quot;Missed paychecks only increases the stress on these essential workers, many of whom are already working mandatory overtime to keep our skies safe and secure,&quot; Delta said in a statement Thursday.

Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy hosted a roundtable at the White House Thursday afternoon with the lobby group Airlines for America, whose members include Delta, United, American and others. &quot;Airlines remain focused on preserving safety and trying to mitigate the operational impacts of this shutdown,&quot; Airlines for America said in a statement. &quot;We are expecting a record holiday travel season; however, if the shutdown continues much longer, Americans will have to pack their patience and be prepared for more delays, unfortunately.&quot; United CEO Scott Kirby told reporters outside the White House that Congress should pass a clean continuing resolution, adding that the shutdown is putting stress on the economy. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, joined by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, speaks to reporters outside the White House on Oct. 30, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images American Airlines said it was unacceptable that the federal employees were working without pay. &quot;A prolonged shutdown will lead to more delays and cancellations — and the American people, especially during the busy holiday season, deserve better,&quot; the company said in a statement. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are essential employees who are required to work through the shutdown even though they are not receiving regular paychecks. The missed paychecks come as controllers grapple with a longstanding staffing shortage. There are 3,800 fewer fully certified controllers than the FAA&#x27;s target, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. &quot;These additional distractions will compound the existing risks in an already strained system,&quot; Daniels said in an opinion piece in The Hill on Tuesday. &quot;Every day the shutdown continues, the National Airspace System becomes less safe than it was the day before, as the controllers&#x27; focus shifts from their critical safety tasks to their financial uncertainty,&quot; he said. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. — CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images American Airlines said it was unacceptable that the federal employees were working without pay. &quot;A prolonged shutdown will lead to more delays and cancellations — and the American people, especially during the busy holiday season, deserve better,&quot; the company said in a statement. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are essential employees who are required to work through the shutdown even though they are not receiving regular paychecks. The missed paychecks come as controllers grapple with a longstanding staffing shortage. There are 3,800 fewer fully certified controllers than the FAA&#x27;s target, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. &quot;These additional distractions will compound the existing risks in an already strained system,&quot; Daniels said in an opinion piece in The Hill on Tuesday. &quot;Every day the shutdown continues, the National Airspace System becomes less safe than it was the day before, as the controllers&#x27; focus shifts from their critical safety tasks to their financial uncertainty,&quot; he said. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. — CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. — CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates.

Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are essential employees who are required to work through the shutdown even though they are not receiving regular paychecks.

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. — CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.
