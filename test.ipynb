The commercial real estate market has been historically slow to modernize, and yet it appears to be accelerating its adoption of artificial intelligence. Companies are moving beyond initial testing and exploration into more targeted applications that aim to redefine value, according to a new survey from JLL. The survey of more than 1,500 senior CRE investor and occupier decision-makers across various industries found that, while still in the early stages, organizations are making AI a priority in their technology budgets. They are also moving from using it just for efficiency to focusing on how it can grow their businesses. JLL found that 88% of investors, owners and landlords said they have started piloting AI, with most pursuing an average of five use cases simultaneously. And more than 90% of occupiers are running corporate real estate AI pilots, according to the report. Compare that with just 5% starting AI pilots two years ago. The adoption is fast, but not entirely easy. Just 5% of respondents said they have achieved all their program goals, while close to half said they have achieved two to three goals. Much of the efforts are still experimental, without much growth. \"If you think about commercial real estate, traditionally, it is not a quick technology adopter, and it\\'s usually skeptical,\" said Yao Morin, chief technology officer at JLL. \"So the high number of adoptions is actually quite surprising to me. What is not surprising on the flip side is that only 5% actually thinks that they have achieved all the goals. This is pretty aligned with a lot of other industries as well.\" Get Property Play directly to your inbox CNBC\\'s Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox. Subscribe here to get access today . The reason they\\'re not hitting their goals is because the goal line has moved. Companies have gone beyond just wanting to do certain tasks faster, or so-called operational efficiencies. Now they are tying AI to their revenue goals. For example, some are using it to help them improve their investment risk models, making investment and portfolio decisions based on the output of AI. That will require big changes to the fundamental way they operate. \"When you really start moving towards the revenue side, the margin expansion side, then it\\'s going to require a lot more than just using a technology,\" Morin explained. \"You can\\'t just say, \\'Well, I\\'m saving you 10% to do this particular thing.\\' Companies need to actually rethink their operating model, to rethink how they organize to actually achieve the savings.\" And so companies are investing heavily in AI, despite economic headwinds. More than half of investors surveyed by JLL have been able to get significant budget growth over the past two years in the space. Their No. 1 spend is on strategic advisory on technology or AI, and most report their budgets have increased solely due to AI. After that, the spending goes to upgrading both cyber- and data-security measures and infrastructure for AI integration. Morin said what she found really surprising is that while most think companies will start using AI for simple tasks, or, low-risk, low-hanging fruit, that was not at all the case. \"Our survey showed the opposite. We are getting to a point of sophistication, beyond this initial skeptical phase, where companies are really focusing on the competitive advantage to pressing business problems, using AI to solve instead of [just] those simple low-risk operations.\" More In CNBC Property Play Why global investment firm Nuveen is betting on this niche real estate subsector Diana Olick Commercial real estate is finally embracing blockchain.

JLL found that 88% of investors, owners and landlords said they have started piloting AI, with most pursuing an average of five use cases simultaneously. Just 5% of respondents said they have achieved all their program goals, while close to half said they have achieved two to three goals. Diminishing perspective of downtown London skyscrapers Chunyip Wong | Istock | Getty Images A version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Property Play newsletter with Diana Olick.

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. The commercial real estate market has been historically slow to modernize, and yet it appears to be accelerating its adoption of artificial intelligence. Companies are moving beyond initial testing and exploration into more targeted applications that aim to redefine value, according to a new survey from JLL. The survey of more than 1,500 senior CRE investor and occupier decision-makers across various industries found that, while still in the early stages, organizations are making AI a priority in their technology budgets. They are also moving from using it just for efficiency to focusing on how it can grow their businesses. JLL found that 88% of investors, owners and landlords said they have started piloting AI, with most pursuing an average of five use cases simultaneously. And more than 90% of occupiers are running corporate real estate AI pilots, according to the report. Compare that with just 5% starting AI pilots two years ago. The adoption is fast, but not entirely easy. Just 5% of respondents said they have achieved all their program goals, while close to half said they have achieved two to three goals. Much of the efforts are still experimental, without much growth. \"If you think about commercial real estate, traditionally, it is not a quick technology adopter, and it\\'s usually skeptical,\" said Yao Morin, chief technology officer at JLL. \"So the high number of adoptions is actually quite surprising to me. What is not surprising on the flip side is that only 5% actually thinks that they have achieved all the goals. This is pretty aligned with a lot of other industries as well.\" Get Property Play directly to your inbox CNBC\\'s Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox. Subscribe here to get access today . The reason they\\'re not hitting their goals is because the goal line has moved. Companies have gone beyond just wanting to do certain tasks faster, or so-called operational efficiencies. Now they are tying AI to their revenue goals. For example, some are using it to help them improve their investment risk models, making investment and portfolio decisions based on the output of AI. That will require big changes to the fundamental way they operate. \"When you really start moving towards the revenue side, the margin expansion side, then it\\'s going to require a lot more than just using a technology,\" Morin explained. \"You can\\'t just say, \\'Well, I\\'m saving you 10% to do this particular thing.\\' Companies need to actually rethink their operating model, to rethink how they organize to actually achieve the savings.\" And so companies are investing heavily in AI, despite economic headwinds. More than half of investors surveyed by JLL have been able to get significant budget growth over the past two years in the space. Their No. 1 spend is on strategic advisory on technology or AI, and most report their budgets have increased solely due to AI. After that, the spending goes to upgrading both cyber- and data-security measures and infrastructure for AI integration. Morin said what she found really surprising is that while most think companies will start using AI for simple tasks, or, low-risk, low-hanging fruit, that was not at all the case. \"Our survey showed the opposite. We are getting to a point of sophistication, beyond this initial skeptical phase, where companies are really focusing on the competitive advantage to pressing business problems, using AI to solve instead of [just] those simple low-risk operations.\" More In CNBC Property Play Why global investment firm Nuveen is betting on this niche real estate subsector Diana Olick Commercial real estate is finally embracing blockchain.

Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty Images Delta Air Lines , United Airlines and American Airlines called on Congress Thursday to reopen the U.S. government and pay air traffic controllers, with Delta urging senators to &quot;immediately pass a clean continuing resolution.&quot; U.S. air traffic controllers missed their first full paychecks on Tuesday as the government shutdown drags on through a fourth week with no end in sight while Republican and Democratic senators remain at an impasse. &quot;Missed paychecks only increases the stress on these essential workers, many of whom are already working mandatory overtime to keep our skies safe and secure,&quot; Delta said in a statement Thursday.

Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy hosted a roundtable at the White House Thursday afternoon with the lobby group Airlines for America, whose members include Delta, United, American and others. &quot;Airlines remain focused on preserving safety and trying to mitigate the operational impacts of this shutdown,&quot; Airlines for America said in a statement. &quot;We are expecting a record holiday travel season; however, if the shutdown continues much longer, Americans will have to pack their patience and be prepared for more delays, unfortunately.&quot; United CEO Scott Kirby told reporters outside the White House that Congress should pass a clean continuing resolution, adding that the shutdown is putting stress on the economy. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, joined by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, speaks to reporters outside the White House on Oct. 30, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images American Airlines said it was unacceptable that the federal employees were working without pay. &quot;A prolonged shutdown will lead to more delays and cancellations — and the American people, especially during the busy holiday season, deserve better,&quot; the company said in a statement. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are essential employees who are required to work through the shutdown even though they are not receiving regular paychecks. The missed paychecks come as controllers grapple with a longstanding staffing shortage. There are 3,800 fewer fully certified controllers than the FAA&#x27;s target, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. &quot;These additional distractions will compound the existing risks in an already strained system,&quot; Daniels said in an opinion piece in The Hill on Tuesday. &quot;Every day the shutdown continues, the National Airspace System becomes less safe than it was the day before, as the controllers&#x27; focus shifts from their critical safety tasks to their financial uncertainty,&quot; he said. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. — CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, joined by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, speaks to reporters outside the White House on Oct. 30, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images American Airlines said it was unacceptable that the federal employees were working without pay. &quot;A prolonged shutdown will lead to more delays and cancellations — and the American people, especially during the busy holiday season, deserve better,&quot; the company said in a statement. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are essential employees who are required to work through the shutdown even though they are not receiving regular paychecks. The missed paychecks come as controllers grapple with a longstanding staffing shortage. There are 3,800 fewer fully certified controllers than the FAA&#x27;s target, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. &quot;These additional distractions will compound the existing risks in an already strained system,&quot; Daniels said in an opinion piece in The Hill on Tuesday. &quot;Every day the shutdown continues, the National Airspace System becomes less safe than it was the day before, as the controllers&#x27; focus shifts from their critical safety tasks to their financial uncertainty,&quot; he said. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. — CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. — CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates.

Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates.

Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty Images Delta Air Lines , United Airlines and American Airlines called on Congress Thursday to reopen the U.S. government and pay air traffic controllers, with Delta urging senators to &quot;immediately pass a clean continuing resolution.&quot; U.S. air traffic controllers missed their first full paychecks on Tuesday as the government shutdown drags on through a fourth week with no end in sight while Republican and Democratic senators remain at an impasse. &quot;Missed paychecks only increases the stress on these essential workers, many of whom are already working mandatory overtime to keep our skies safe and secure,&quot; Delta said in a statement Thursday.

Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy hosted a roundtable at the White House Thursday afternoon with the lobby group Airlines for America, whose members include Delta, United, American and others. &quot;Airlines remain focused on preserving safety and trying to mitigate the operational impacts of this shutdown,&quot; Airlines for America said in a statement. &quot;We are expecting a record holiday travel season; however, if the shutdown continues much longer, Americans will have to pack their patience and be prepared for more delays, unfortunately.&quot; United CEO Scott Kirby told reporters outside the White House that Congress should pass a clean continuing resolution, adding that the shutdown is putting stress on the economy. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, joined by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, speaks to reporters outside the White House on Oct. 30, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images American Airlines said it was unacceptable that the federal employees were working without pay. &quot;A prolonged shutdown will lead to more delays and cancellations — and the American people, especially during the busy holiday season, deserve better,&quot; the company said in a statement. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are essential employees who are required to work through the shutdown even though they are not receiving regular paychecks. The missed paychecks come as controllers grapple with a longstanding staffing shortage. There are 3,800 fewer fully certified controllers than the FAA&#x27;s target, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. &quot;These additional distractions will compound the existing risks in an already strained system,&quot; Daniels said in an opinion piece in The Hill on Tuesday. &quot;Every day the shutdown continues, the National Airspace System becomes less safe than it was the day before, as the controllers&#x27; focus shifts from their critical safety tasks to their financial uncertainty,&quot; he said. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. — CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

       "       'Cách chúng ta biến mất khi đuổi theo những cuộc đời không phải của mình.Amber. Ngày 15 tháng 5 năm 2025Bài dịch từ Amber. Link bài gốc: “Ôi, được thức dậy với lòng biết ơn vì nhịp đập nơi cổ họng; được đối diện với gương mà không thấy sợ hãi. Tôi cần phải đủ—cho chính mình.”\\nChúng ta lạc lối biết bao, trong thế giới ảo của cuộc sống.Họ nói chúng ta may mắn, khi được sống trong kỷ nguyên của những cánh cửa vô tận; của vô số phiên bản bản thân đang chờ được triệu hồi chỉ bằng một cái lướt, một bài đăng, hay một màn lột xác từng bước.\\xa0Nhưng không ai cảnh báo chúng ta về căn bệnh mà nó mang theo. Về việc quá nhiều khả năng có thể làm rách nát các khía cạnh bản thể của một con người.Da thịt chúng ta khao khát những buổi sáng bắt đầu bằng ánh sáng ban mai chứ không phải ánh sáng màn hình. Trước khi chân chạm đất, mắt chúng ta đã lạc vào thế giới của người khác. Chúng ta không nhận ra khi nào mình ngừng sống và chỉ chăm chăm quan sát người khác. Ta đã trở thành khán giả của tất cả mọi người - mà chẳng còn tham gia vào điều gì thuộc về chính mình.Chúng ta so sánh những góc khuất trần trụi của cuộc sống mình với thước phim nổi bật của người khác. Hy vọng giờ đây nở rộ từ lòng đố kỵ. Cơ thể ngày càng xa lạ với chính mình.Và tôi đã trở thành một nghĩa địa của những hình tượng. Bồn chồn trước sự hiện diện của những niềm vui giản dị. Luôn sợ hãi việc an cư lạc nghiệp. Tôi từng nghĩ mình thất bại vì chưa đi đến đâu, nhưng tôi chỉ đơn giản là đã lạc lối giữa những mâu thuẫn của các tấm bản đồ khác nhau, lang thang quá nhiều con đường.Tôi vọng tưởng những thành phố mình sẽ không bao giờ đặt chân đến và những sự nghiệp đã chết trước khi sơ yếu lý lịch kịp ghi tên chúng. Tôi thương tiếc những người lạ mà tôi suýt yêu; bỏ lại trong những dòng tin nhắn chưa mở. Vì có chăng chỉ cần lướt thêm một chút thì sẽ có một người khác; dịu dàng hơn, hài hước hơn, dễ dàng hơn, phù hợp hơn với tôi hơn?Tôi là ngàn lần suýt nữa, được giữ lại bằng sự do dự; là một bộ sưu tập của những phiên bản tự tô vẽ lại.Và tôi kiệt sức vì quỹ đạo liên tục xoay quanh tiềm năng này. Sự rỉ máu ý nghĩa chậm rãi này. Một cuộc tán tỉnh hàng ngày với những gì tôi không phải, những gì tôi không có, và những gì tôi chưa làm. Đâu đó trên đường đi, tôi đã ngừng hỏi mình muốn gì và bắt đầu hỏi điều gì sẽ trông ấn tượng. Và những gì xã hội tôn thờ thay đổi quá nhanh, tâm lý đó trở nên bất ổn khi giá trị được đo bằng xu hướng.Họ nói sự lựa chọn sẽ có vị như tự do, nhưng không nói rằng nó là một vị ngọt gây nghiện. Vị ngọt làm thối rữa dạ dày, cho đến khi bản năng ta mất phương hướng. Chúng ta không chỉ chịu đựng sự dư thừa của các lựa chọn, chúng ta còn chịu đựng sự thiếu cam kết.Và tôi không muốn thêm cánh cửa nào nữa—tôi muốn bước qua một cánh cửa mà không ngoảnh lại. Tôi muốn yêu một điều gì đó đủ lâu để cảm nhận nó yêu lại tôi. Tôi muốn đặt nền móng trên một mảnh đất không hoàn hảo và gọi đó là nhà.Nhưng tôi đã đánh mất chính mình trong hàng triệu người khác. Tôi không còn nói trôi chảy ngôn ngữ của riêng mình nữa. Tôi đã tiêu thụ quá nhiều giấc mơ không phải của mình, đến nỗi tôi không nhận ra cơn đói khát vọng của chính mình.Đây không phải là tự do. Đây là sự xói mòn. Đây là sự tan rã chậm chạp của bản ngã dưới ảo ảnh rằng chúng ta có thể là bất cứ điều gì, tất cả mọi thứ, cùng một lúc.Tôi mới 23 tuổi, và đã phải đau buồn cho một cuộc đời mà tôi đã không chung thủy; quá bận rộn để thử vai cho tất cả những cuộc đời tôi có thể có. Tôi bị ám ảnh bởi thời gian tôi đã dành cho cái feed vô tận này. Bao nhiêu khoảnh khắc thiêng liêng tôi đã bỏ lỡ, khi nhìn vào sân sau của người khác; chỉ để nhổ đi những mầm cây của mình và trồng thứ họ đã gieo?Có những quả chín không chạm tới trong những cây tôi đã trồng. Nhưng tôi không thể lãng phí thêm một mùa nào nữa để khám phá những khu vườn khác. Tôi muốn trở về khu vườn của mình. Để vun xới nó, nuôi dưỡng nó, gặt hái thành quả từ nỗ lực của mình.Nếu tôi nói với bạn rằng cơn khát được trải nghiệm mọi thứ này, sự vươn tới không ngừng này, nhu cầu cảm thấy điều gì đó hơn thế, không phải là sự tò mò, mà là sự lưu đày bản thân? Đâu đó trên đường đi, bạn đã bắt đầu tin rằng sống có nghĩa là trở nên phi thường; được nhìn thấy; được lựa chọn. Rằng nó có nghĩa là tiêu thụ mọi thứ thế giới mang lại.Nhưng bạn được sinh ra để trở về nhà với chính mình. Với thức ăn của riêng bạn; với chiếc giường của riêng bạn.Và sự thật là, không có gì bạn đang theo đuổi sẽ neo giữ được bạn. Không phải thành công. Không phải sự ngưỡng mộ. Thậm chí không phải sự chữa lành. Bởi vì khoảnh khắc bạn cuối cùng tĩnh lặng, bạn sẽ nghe thấy nó—cuộc đời quý giá của chính bạn, đang nức nở trong góc phòng, cầu xin:“Tôi đã đợi bạn ngừng cố gắng trở nên phi thường, ngừng cố gắng trở thành ‘họ’, tất cả để tôi có thể yêu bạn như bạn vốn có.”Hãy từ bỏ màn trình diễn. Ảo tưởng vĩ đại nhất là bạn phải kiếm được sự sống động của mình. Nhưng bạn không cần. Bạn chưa bao giờ cần. Bạn đang, ngay tại khoảnh khắc này, tự mình mở ra.Và điều đó là đủ, làm ơn, hãy để điều đó là đủ.Bạn à, không ai muốn bị chôn vùi với sự hối tiếc. Bạn xứng đáng có một cuộc sống không cần cảm thấy phải trốn thoát qua màn hình.Và trong sự tĩnh lặng của bạn, trong sự bình thường dịu dàng của cuộc đời không nhãn mác đó, bạn sẽ nhận ra: sự cô độc - sự hiện diện đích thực - không phải là cái chết của ý nghĩa. Nó chính là nơi sinh ra ý nghĩa đó.Cơn khát được trở thành tất cả mọi thứ, chưa bao giờ là gì khác ngoài nỗi khao khát được yêu thương.Nhưng bạn luôn xứng đáng.Ngay cả khi chỉ là một điều duy nhất, đích thực, tuyệt vời: chính là bản thân bạn.\\n- tôi biết bạn sẽ học cách sống cho chính mình, Amber.Thế giới nói với bạn rằng bạn có thể là bất cứ ai, vì vậy bạn quên mất cách trở thành chính mình. Nó cho bạn thấy mọi thứ bạn có thể trở thành, vì vậy bạn từ bỏ những gì bạn đã là. Nó mang đến cho bạn hàng triệu cuộc đời; bạn không chọn cái nào, và đánh mất cái vốn đã là của bạn.Xin chân thành cảm ơn bạn đã đọc—nếu điều này giữ chân bạn dù chỉ trong một khoảnh khắc, tôi hy vọng bạn sẽ ở lại. Sẽ còn nhiều sự dịu dàng hơn, nhiều sự thật hơn, nhiều sự ấm áp hơn sắp đến. 🤍8'],\n",
