United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, joined by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, speaks to reporters outside the White House on Oct. 30, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images American Airlines said it was unacceptable that the federal employees were working without pay. &quot;A prolonged shutdown will lead to more delays and cancellations \u2014 and the American people, especially during the busy holiday season, deserve better,&quot; the company said in a statement. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are essential employees who are required to work through the shutdown even though they are not receiving regular paychecks. The missed paychecks come as controllers grapple with a longstanding staffing shortage. There are 3, 800 fewer fully certified controllers than the FAA&#x27;s target, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. &quot;These additional distractions will compound the existing risks in an already strained system,&quot; Daniels said in an opinion piece in The Hill on Tuesday. &quot;Every day the shutdown continues, the National Airspace System becomes less safe than it was the day before, as the controllers&#x27; focus shifts from their critical safety tasks to their financial uncertainty,&quot; he said. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. \u2014 CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, joined by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, speaks to reporters outside the White House on Oct. 30, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images American Airlines said it was unacceptable that the federal employees were working without pay. &quot;A prolonged shutdown will lead to more delays and cancellations \u2014 and the American people, especially during the busy holiday season, deserve better,&quot; the company said in a statement. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are essential employees who are required to work through the shutdown even though they are not receiving regular paychecks. The missed paychecks come as controllers grapple with a longstanding staffing shortage. There are 3, 800 fewer fully certified controllers than the FAA&#x27;s target, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. &quot;These additional distractions will compound the existing risks in an already strained system,&quot; Daniels said in an opinion piece in The Hill on Tuesday. &quot;Every day the shutdown continues, the National Airspace System becomes less safe than it was the day before, as the controllers&#x27; focus shifts from their critical safety tasks to their financial uncertainty,&quot; he said. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. \u2014 CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, joined by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, speaks to reporters outside the White House on Oct. 30, 2025 in Washington, D.C.

Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are essential employees who are required to work through the shutdown even though they are not receiving regular paychecks. The missed paychecks come as controllers grapple with a longstanding staffing shortage. There are 3, 800 fewer fully certified controllers than the FAA&#x27;s target, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. &quot;These additional distractions will compound the existing risks in an already strained system,&quot; Daniels said in an opinion piece in The Hill on Tuesday. &quot;Every day the shutdown continues, the National Airspace System becomes less safe than it was the day before, as the controllers&#x27; focus shifts from their critical safety tasks to their financial uncertainty,&quot; he said. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. \u2014 CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, joined by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, speaks to reporters outside the White House on Oct. 30, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images American Airlines said it was unacceptable that the federal employees were working without pay. &quot;A prolonged shutdown will lead to more delays and cancellations \u2014 and the American people, especially during the busy holiday season, deserve better,&quot; the company said in a statement. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are essential employees who are required to work through the shutdown even though they are not receiving regular paychecks. The missed paychecks come as controllers grapple with a longstanding staffing shortage. There are 3, 800 fewer fully certified controllers than the FAA&#x27;s target, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. &quot;These additional distractions will compound the existing risks in an already strained system,&quot; Daniels said in an opinion piece in The Hill on Tuesday. &quot;Every day the shutdown continues, the National Airspace System becomes less safe than it was the day before, as the controllers&#x27; focus shifts from their critical safety tasks to their financial uncertainty,&quot; he said. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. \u2014 CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, joined by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, speaks to reporters outside the White House on Oct. 30, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images American Airlines said it was unacceptable that the federal employees were working without pay. &quot;A prolonged shutdown will lead to more delays and cancellations \u2014 and the American people, especially during the busy holiday season, deserve better,&quot; the company said in a statement. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are essential employees who are required to work through the shutdown even though they are not receiving regular paychecks. The missed paychecks come as controllers grapple with a longstanding staffing shortage. There are 3, 800 fewer fully certified controllers than the FAA&#x27;s target, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. &quot;These additional distractions will compound the existing risks in an already strained system,&quot; Daniels said in an opinion piece in The Hill on Tuesday. &quot;Every day the shutdown continues, the National Airspace System becomes less safe than it was the day before, as the controllers&#x27; focus shifts from their critical safety tasks to their financial uncertainty,&quot; he said. The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Senate Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement to keep the government open. Democratic senators are insisting that Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies before they will vote for funding to reopen the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that a four-week shutdown would cost the economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026. A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates. Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred. \u2014 CNBC&#x27;s Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.
